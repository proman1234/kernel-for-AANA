# Dear Reader,
# I have written a code for "The uniformly strong consistency of kernel-type distribution estimator under asymptotically almost negatively associated samples" and attached it here.
# Please see it and let me know your opinion. You should have already installed "survival" library in R. I hope to be useful to a person.

# With Best Wishes for you,

# Shipeng Wu
